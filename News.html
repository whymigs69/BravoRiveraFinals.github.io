                        <p>The Arellano University – Andres Bonifacio Campus delegation comprised three outstanding students, each assigned in different subject categories of the competition:</p><br>
                        <p>1. Ma. Cristina B. Saborrido – English</p><br>
                        <p>2. Aaron Justin Lei B. Alay – Mathematics</p><br>
                        <p>3. Lorraine Claire F. Diongco – Science</p><br>
                        <p>These three great students had the good fortune to have Mr. Francis Alfred F. Suyod as their mentor in representing Arellano University – Andres Bonifacio Campus.
                             By sharing his expertise in all three areas, this coach ensured that the squad was prepared for any obstacle.</p><br>

                             <p>In the English category, Ma. Christina emerged as the 3rd place among all 
                                participating schools. Her unwavering determination and eloquence in English made her leave an indelible mark on the competition.</p><br>
                             <p>Meanwhile, in the Mathematics category, Aaron secured an impressive 2nd place. With a keen mind and focus, he managed to beat
                                 almost all his competitors. His math abilities and strategic thinking were nothing short of extraordinary.</p><br>
                             <p>And then, there was Lorraine—a force to be reckoned with. She was exposed to different scientific questions that require critical thinking
                                 and grit which she already possesses. Because of her strong willingness to win, she secured a clincher round for which she also won. This made her
                                  secure the overall 1st place of the competition in the Science category.</p><br>
                             <p>During the event's awarding and conclusion, delegates from Arellano University – Andres Bonifacio Campus were on the verge of joy. As a symbol of
                                 their significant victories, they proudly and confidently came up to receive their medals and certificates.</p><br>
